time spent: 2.00  hour

 DISCO:
 - It is possible to use overloaded constructors without default constructors (see Fairy.java, Elf.java, and Wizard.java, which have constructors that take in a name parameter)>
 - Initialize variables as instance variables if you want to use them in different methods! 
 - N from class: A protected instance variable is accessible by a class and all its subclasses. For example, _hitpoints in Protagonist is accessible by Protagonist, Fairy, Elf,>
 - We can print out the static about() method of each class when allowing the user to pick their characters.
 - NumberFormatException Error: https://piazza.com/class/kue5pmk0w7n70n?cid=282
