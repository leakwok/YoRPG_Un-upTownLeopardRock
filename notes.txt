time spent: 2.00  hour

 * DISCO:
 *      - It is possible to use overloaded constructors without default constructors (see Fairy.java, Elf.java, and Wizard.java, which have constructors that take in a name parameter)>
 *      - Initialize variables as instance variables if you want to use them in different methods! 
 *      - N from class: A protected instance variable is accessible by a class and all its subclasses. For example, _hitpoints in Protagonist is accessible by Protagonist, Fairy, Elf,>
 *      - We can print out the static about() method of each class when allowing the user to pick their characters.
 * QCC:
 *      - Protagonist is-a Character.
 *      - Fairy is-a Protagonist.
 *      - Elf is-a Protagonist.
 *      - Wizard is-a Protagonist.
 *      - Monster is-a Character.
 *      - Ogre is-a Monster.
 *      - Dragon is-a Monster.
 *      - Snowman is-a Monster.
 *              OUR INHERITANCE TREE
 *                      Character
 *      Protagonist                     Monster
 * Fairy   Elf  Wizard           Ogre  Dragon  Snowman
 * OUR DRIVER MODS:
 *      - created instance variables monsterChoice and protagChoice to store the number corresponding to the character's choice of opponent and protagonist role, respectively.
 *      - added selection phase to newGame(), which printed out explanatory questions and Monster + Protagonist subclass choices, with their about() methods.
 *      - added if statements to playTurn() to initialize and Protagonist pat and Monster smaug to the player's choices.
